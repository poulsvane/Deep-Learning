# Deep-Learning

#### Folder structure
The final network, together with notebook, code and data can be found in 'DeepLearningDTUPython/RNNStructure/'. 

The folder 'DeepLearningDTU' is early version of the network. 

The folder 'CommaPlacementNotebooks' should be ignored.

Since the file containing all our sentences is too large for github, we have created a dropbox folder containing the csv files.
